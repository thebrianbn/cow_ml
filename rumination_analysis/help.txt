predict kgPerH_ashed from military time, blood content (BUN,gluc,nefa,insu), ammonia, sequence, treatment, time
 ((*** assume linear relation between ammonia and time *** )
(((*** assume both linear relation and no relation ( stays same value)

alternatively, predit kgPer_asfed from ilitary time, treatment, sequence, ignoring external data as that's somewhat based on treatment and sequence.

try both
